<p>The first week at NSS started out as most first weeks at a new school do.  ##john wark## gave us our orientation and we were introduced to our teacher #eliza# and teacherâ€™s assistants ###Scott## and ##Peder##.  We were given the wifi password and went around the room with introductions.  Then we pretty much delved into it.  In what seemed like much longer then a week ago we we were given a website to recreate with our own HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Any confidence I came into the class with was quickly erased by my unknown unknowns of those languages.  To make that more exciting we were asked to use MacVIM as our editor.  I also learned the joys of using git early and often to push projects to my newly acquired GitHub account.</p>
